Create a group of devices, and control them trogether.

With this app you can create a new group of devices and then control all the devices from the group.

When creating a new group simply:

 1) Choose the class of group you want (ie. lights)
 2) Select the devices you want in the group
 3) Pick the icon you want to use for the group

The app will create a group of the selected devices, where you can control all of their common capabilities.

With in the advance settings, you can also change how the group app reports back information from the devices.
For example, you can choose whether a group of temperature sensors to show the lowest or highest values instead of the average value of all devices in the group.

If you are looking for something a little more advance¹ the app offers the following :

Unified Groups
These same as a normal group, but you are no longer restricted bu device class.
You can use these groups for additional flexibility, or advance use cases, but the advance settings are harder to manage.

Blended Groups
Group that include devices with different capabilities.
You can use these groups to control similar devices, for example a group with a light which only dims and a light which has colour changing capability.
When changing the the brightness, a blended group will change all devices brightness, but changing the colour will only change that on the devices where it is possible.

Fused Groups
These are a special type, which "fuse" devices together, creating a single device out of one or more devices.
When creating a new group, you will be asked which device to control for which action.
Fusing groups can be useful in situations like when you have a zwave switch and a hue globe and you may want to use the switch when turning off/on or reading the power, but the hue globe when setting the dim/color.

Conjoined Groups
These are groups where you can specify which capabilities you would like to be added to the group.
Giving the most control as to how the group is created.



¹ Note that the advance groups, are generally for power users and can be a little harder to manage.
