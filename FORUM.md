## Notes

When changing from v1.10 to the beta, you will have to re-create your groups.


## Using

1. After installing, to add a new Group, click  + (add) upon the devices tab select "Group".
2. Now select the group device's class. (e.g. Light).
3. You will now see all the capabilities supported by this class. Now chose the ones you need. (e.g. Turned on" and "Dim level", "Temperature" ).
4. On this page you will find all devices that have the capabilities you selected, simply select the devices you want to group.
5. On this final page you change change the icon of the device if you would like, or select next to use the default.
6. Now you have one device to control all the grouped devices.

## Feature List :

###  :white_check_mark: Groups different  (or the same) devices together
You can group as many devices as you would like together, allowing them all to be controlled / or viewed as one device.

_eg. Group all the lights in your house and control the all at once, either as a device or flow_
_eg. Group all your contact sensors and be able to see if any doors or windows have been left open_
_eg. Group all your temperature sensors and if the average temp of your house goes down, turn on the heater_

### :white_check_mark: Simplify your flows
Simplify your flows by adding a group to any part of the flow and have the action carried out upon the entire group.

_eg. If any motion sensor detects motion then turn on all the lights in your house  _
_eg. If the sum of power used by all devices is greater 700W then turn set all the heaters in your house for 5 min _


### :white_check_mark: Enhance your flows
Enhance your flows by having them only trigger when you want, you can even make it so that a group will only turn on if the (sum, average, mean average, min, max) meets a criteria.

###  :white_check_mark: Supports most device classes
You can now add groups for any category from kettles to sensors and everything between 18 categories are supported, the rest to be added once available in Homey 2.

### :white_check_mark: Now supports all device capabilities
All standard device capabilities are now supported, this means that you can now group anything from  temperature sensors, lux sensors, motion alarms, vacuum cleaner states, power measurements. All 72 capabilities have been added.

### :white_check_mark: Give feedback on device status

Your group cards will now give feedback if something changes with in the group, either in or outside of the Homey App.

_eg. In a grouped set of Hue lights, if you change the colour of the lights to red with in the Hue app, your device group card will now show as red._

### :white_check_mark: Choose how information is display method

You can now choose how each groups capability will be reported back to you.

_eg. Set the grouped temperature sensors to show the average temperature, but the highest humidity value._
_eg. Show the total amount of power used for all grouped lights, but median average dim levels_
_eg. Only set the light card on if all lights are on, but turn on the grouped motion sensors if any detect motion._

### :white_check_mark: See more information, quicker.
You can now click on a group's settings to see which devices, which capabilities have been included and which method is being used to display the results. As always you can still change the values from the app settings, along with which method is being used.

### :white_check_mark: Choose your language.
Added support for English, Dutch and German, please note - I don't speak German or Dutch, if there are any issues please let me know. 

@Jamie : English (EN) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
@Jaxc : Dutch (NL) ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±
@PhilS : German (DE) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

### :white_check_mark: Make your own categories
Added support for the 'other' category, this category is unique in that all capabilities and icons are displayed with in it - As this is not the standard category - how this will work with third parties (alexa/google) is currently unknown. 



### Other

Lots of other small fixes, and features

Otherwise everything else is as advertised in the post, hit me up on Slack (@jamie) if you have any questions or issues.

Finally if you could let me know what does work, as well as what doesnâ€™t, it would be really helpful as I am unable to test some devices myself.
